Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Software engineering disciplines began in 1960
2. Advent of structured programming in 1970
3. Rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: Releasign the software to users or customers
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancement to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method adopts a sequential approach wtih distinct phases. E.g applicable in projects with well-defined requirements
Agile method provides a iterative and flexible approach. E.g applicable in flexible projects to achieve customer satisfaction

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: writes code and implement software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: oversees planning, execution and delivery of software system
System Architect: designs the overall structure and architecture of software system
UI/UX Designer: create user interfaces and designs user experiences for software application.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. E.g Visual Studio, Eclipse
Version Control Systems: track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. E.g Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines - should be avoided by providing adequate timelines for the tasks
Changing Requirement - could be minimized by adopting a standard change management system for every project

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit: Involves testing individual components or modules of software. 
Integration: involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System: Involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance: Involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts (questions or instructions) to obtain specific responses from AI models. It enables AI engineers to create better services which are able to handle complex tasks.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about sport
Improved prompt: Tell me about the history of table tennis in the United States of America
Improved prompt ensure that AI understands the request better
